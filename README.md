**Machine Learning Engineering & Algorithmic Portfolio**

This repository serves as a centralized showcase of my expertise in Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning. It documents a rigorous journey through data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and the deployment of predictive and descriptive analytics to solve real-world problems.

**Supervised Learning: Predictive Modeling**
I build models that learn from historical data to predict future numerical outcomes (Regression) or categorize data into distinct groups (Classification).

📉 1.**Regression Analysis (Continuous Predictions)**
Mastery of models used to predict quantities, prices, and trends based on independent variables.

Simple Linear Regression: Establishing the foundational relationship between a single feature and a target (e.g., Years of Experience vs. Salary).

Multiple Linear Regression: Mapping complex relationships involving multiple features while managing the "Dummy Variable Trap" and multicollinearity.

Polynomial Regression: Modeling non-linear relationships to capture curves in data.

Support Vector Regression (SVR): Using kernels to manage high-dimensional data and outliers.

Decision Tree & Random Forest Regression: Implementing ensemble methods to predict values through non-linear, hierarchical branching.


**Classification (Categorical Decision Making)**
Developing logic-based "Gatekeepers" to identify labels and classes within a dataset.

Logistic Regression: Predict probability-based outcomes for binary classification.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Using proximity-based logic to categorize data points.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) & Kernel SVM: Creating optimal hyperplanes to separate classes in both linear and non-linear spaces.

Naive Bayes: Implementing probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes' Theorem.

Decision Tree & Random Forest Classification: Using "The Wisdom of the Crowd" (Ensemble Learning) to build highly accurate and robust classification systems.

**Unsupervised Learning: Pattern Discovery**
I specialize in identifying the "hidden architecture" of data where no pre-defined labels exist.

Clustering (Market & User Segmentation)
K-Means Clustering: Segmenting populations into $K$ distinct groups using the Elbow Method and WCSS for optimal centroid placement.
Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative): Building a bottom-up taxonomy of data. Utilized Dendrograms and Ward’s Method to visualize the "Family Tree" of consumer behavior.

**Association Rule Learning (Relational Intelligence)**

Apriori Algorithm: Extracting meaningful associations (If A, then B) from large transaction databases using Support, Confidence, and Lift.
ECLAT Model: Implementing high-speed, vertical-format frequent itemset discovery through Set Intersections.
Application: Analyzed 7,501 Belgian retail transactions to drive cross-selling strategies and shelf-space optimization.


**Reinforcement Learning: Reward-Based Optimization**

I implement models designed to learn optimal strategies through interaction with an environment, maximizing cumulative rewards over time.

Upper Confidence Bound (UCB): A deterministic algorithm used to solve the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem, balancing exploration of new options with exploitation of known successful ones.

Thompson Sampling: A probabilistic (Bayesian) approach to the Multi-Armed Bandit problem that often outperforms UCB by managing uncertainty more dynamically.

Application: These models are essential for Modern Ad-Tech (identifying which ad performs best) and Dynamic Pricing where the environment changes in real-time.
